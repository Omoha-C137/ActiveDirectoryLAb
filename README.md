<h1>Active Directory Home Lab</h1>

 

<h2>Description</h2>
In this home lab project on Active Directory involves setting up a simulated network environment to learn and experiment with Active Directory, a Microsoft-developed directory service. The project aims to guide individuals through the process of creating a basic home lab with Active Directory1.

The lab setup typically involves setting up virtual machines using software like VMWare or Oracle VirtualBox. These machines can include a Windows Server acting as a Domain Controller and several Windows 10 machines acting as user machines1.

The project allows users to learn about user management, security, and administrative tasks within a network environment. It provides hands-on experience with setting up domain controllers, creating and managing user accounts, setting permissions, and understanding Group Policy Objects2.

This project is an excellent opportunity for IT beginners and professionals alike to gain practical knowledge and experience with Active Directory
